## Commit Meaning

I thought it would be great to have meaning for my commits while learning git. Even though it is still a bad idea.

| Naming   | Meaning               |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| ini      | Initialize new thing  |
| add      | Add something         |
| rmv      | Remove something      |
| ref      | Refactor codebase     |
| imp      | Implement idea        |
| fix      | Fix bug/error         |
| doc      | Ducumentation stuff   |
